# From the p-value and level of significance, it can be predicted that
# dependent variable y (yield) depends on fertilization and irrigation.
# Since p value is less than 0.05, (even less than 0.001), it can be predicted
# that one group is statistically significantly diff from at least one group.
# However, which group is diff from which one, that can be determined by post-hoc test.
# degrees of freedom (Df), residuals, F value and p value are usually included in report.
# Residual Df is, sample size - no. of cells. In this dataset, n = 120, cells=6.
# Cells are -> ctrl (high, low irr), Nitrogen (high, low irr), N+P (high, low irr)
# Interaction between fert and irr is not significantly diff (p > 0.05).
# It means that fert and irr independently influence yield or production.
# High or low irrigation does not change the effect of fertilizer and vice versa.
# Assumptions to be maintained before post-hoc test:
# Homogeneity of variance, normal distribution of residuals
#Assumptions visual checks

# From the Q-Q residuals plot, normally distributed data can be predicted
# if the data are closely dispersed along the diagonal line.
# Scale Location and Constant Leverage plots indicate if homogeneity of
# variance is maintained. the horizontal line across the plot will be straight or
# close enough if it is maintained.
# Statistical test to check normal distribution
# Shapiro-Wilk on residuals (normality)
# residual value = yield - corresponding mean

# p value greater than 0.05, therefore no sig diff in variances
# Homogeneity of variance is maintained.

# In high irr, sig diff is present between ctrl and N effect, while no sig diff
# between N and N+P. That means farmers will be suggested to use fertilizer.
# It can be either N or N+P. Same is seen for low irr.
# This is why there was no interaction effect between N and N+P.
# If p-value was less than 0.05 (interaction effect present),
# then the fertilizer with higher mean would be suggested to use.
